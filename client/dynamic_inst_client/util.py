class Filter:
    """
    Function filter, used to filter function based on status, selection and name.
    :ivar __status_filter: None for no filter, 'active' for active functions, 'nopped' for nopped functions
    :ivar __selected filter: None for no filter, 'selected' for selected functions,
        'unselected' for un-selected functions
    :ivar __regex: The regex for the function name, empty or None for no filter
    :cvar filter: The filter property, uses the __set_filter function to modify the filter
    The filter's format is:
        [op1]:[op2]:[regex]
        Where op1 and op2 can be:
            active/nopped: To filter based on the function's status
            selected/unselected: To filter based on the current selection
        The regex must follow the Python's regex rules.
        All the parameters are optional, an empty filters accepts all, the op's must be followed by the ':' character
        Examples:
            active:-> Filters currently active functions
            active:do_.*-> Filters currently active functions witht the name that respects 'do_.*'
            nopped:selected:-> Filters currently nopped functions that are selected
            nopped:unselected:main-> Filters currently nopped functions that are not selected and that start with 'main'
